                   <p align="justify"><img src="comets_logo_r2.JPG" alt="Comets Logo" width="198" height="197" style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Comets is the name of the Association of Computer Science at Mangalam College of Engineering. We were given the opportunity for designing a cool logo and some mind blowing Presentations. We did a lot of research for the best look and feel. Since we had very little time for developmental activities, we had to resort to modify the glowing logo and give it a border. The next challenge was the text for the logo. After testing a number of fonts, we manually drew out a rough sketch on paper and moulded it with the help of special tools. </p>
                   <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentations were quite successful but took a big toll as some straight 10 hours continuous work was required just hours before the inauguration ceremony to complete it.</p>
                   <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="comets_txt.jpg" alt="Comets" width="280" height="70" style="float:right;padding: 10px;">The next big event was the Quiz program. This time we had prepared for it and so came out with a template for the quiz program, but there was a technical problem with the score updations. The reason was that we did not test the network features before going ahead with the program. Aside that the program was grand. </p>

                   <p>&nbsp;After long times on development and other obligations we finally redesigned this site adding a number of cool features and a complete section for tutorials.
