            <p align="justify">We take a look at the various solutions that are being provided by ae, mhkonline2 and our partners.</p>
            <h3>Interactive CDs </h3>
            <p align="justify">We have done more than 50 interactive CDs (also called i cds) with 
            customized contents.&nbsp; The design and development side is controlled and managed under artistik expressionz. We use advanced java scripts, flash and other state of the art technologies. </p>
            <h3>Technical Solutions </h3>
            <p align="justify">We provide technical solutions in the form of Hosting and business solutions with our partnering company <a href="http://www.angelsvista.com" target="_blank">Angelsvista</a>. In 2005 February we made the software for presentations and a college quiz competition which was a grand success. We have improved that program and it is available fully customized as 'Interactive Quiz Program 3.2.8'. We are currently working on a number of software projects. </p>
            <h3 align="justify">Web Development </h3>
            <p align="justify">With the help of our development partners <a href="http://www.angelsvista.com" target="_blank">Angelsvista</a>, we provide complete web design solutions. Also giving us help we have <a href="http://www.mystikmissionz.bravehost.com" target="_blank">Mystik Missionz</a>. We have undertaken several projects. Some of our completed projects include :</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p align="left">        <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tkmcivil/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/tkmcivil/</a><br>
                    Done for the Civil Dept of TKM College of Engg, Kollam. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <h3 align="left">Graphics &amp; Design</h3>
            <p align="justify">Ae is the root of our design and development since it started.&nbsp; Since most of our works are related with designing, ae plays a very important role. We are into designing logos, corporate identities, posters, web sites etc. We designed the logo for our Angelsvista. Also the interfaces to i cds are under the control of ae. We provide professional quality works. The latest solution that we provide are custom Flash animations for a number of purposes. This move is following the winning Ist pace in an animation competition in a National Technical Fest. </p>
            <p align="justify">We have done some attractive, creative 
            and spectacular posters for a number of colleges and clients. We have had 
            good response so far from our clients. We also design wallpapers for special 
            occasions both as our own projects and also for our clients.</p>
            <h3 align="justify">Simulated Database Application </h3>
            <p align="justify">As a result of our needs and our constant desire for Research and Development has led us to the implementation processes of a simulated Database application. It is basically a Javascript based application that simulates a database. Ofcourse there is no security for sensitive information, need for the client's browser to run the app. But our needs were so that we could go forward with this project for our Tutorials and Downloads section. It has cut developmental time many folds. We will shortly explain the implementation details in the Javascript tutorials section soon. </p>
            <h3 align="justify">Slide Viewer</h3>
            <p align="justify">Slide Viewer is a live application that we are 
            developing. Here using JavaScript, we are displaying numerous contents using 
            a single page. It is only a developing technology, so minor tweaks are 
            needed. Using the R &amp; D from this project, we have created the show_wallpaper - a one page interface that shows all of our wallpapers. Try it out from <a href="../downloads/wallpapers.html">here</a>. </p>
            <h3 align="justify">Da Play List</h3>
            <p align="justify">This is also a live application that we successfully 
            implemented in our interactive Cds. This project features making a play list 
            using JavaScript and the concept of cookies.&nbsp; Once the play list is all 
            set and playing starts, you don't have to manually change the song from 
            within the html interface of the interactive cd. After each song ends, the 
            next song in the play list gets played. The aim of this project is to make 
            the interactive interface a completely different and easy one. Unfortunately 
            we couldn't include a preview for 'da Play List' because of space 
            constraints. However the technology will be explained under JavaScript 
            tutorials soon.</p>
