            <div class="title">New logo for Artistik Expressionz</div>
            <span class="sub_text">June 2005 </span>
            <p>Finally its here, the long awaited arrival of the new logo for   Artistik Expressionz. The completely redesigned and simplified logo was   officially launched in May 2005, after many painstaking hours of work and   thoughts. We also changed the font to suit our new logo. Don't think that we've   made a spelling mistake, it has been intentionally done so, shall we say to give   it an artistic feeling. Its simple, its elementary, its different!</p>
            <p>Artistik Expressionz has been the root of our designing and   development ever since it was started. Any kind of designing work or that with   an interactive end is assigned to it. It was firstly called by its full name.   But now, with the advent of the new logo and new style, its simply called ae. Ae   has sort of become synonymous with simplicity.</p>
            <p>Ae is all about&nbsp; the integrity of pure design. It shows how much   importance we give to good designing as Ae has been formed exclusively to take   care of that. We are poised to make good designs by combining the best of both   worlds. The new logo signifies this outlook. It is a radical element that acts   like an icon. Ae has already made its mark in many varied design oriented   projects and we hope to improve our work as we help others.</p>          
            <p> So a whole page dedicated to Ae, which of course is behind the creation   of this entire website. With&nbsp; Ae, we are all set to go international. Wherever   simplicity and integrity merge, Artistik Expressionz will be   there because ae rulez!&nbsp; </p>

            <div class="title">Mhkonline to be redesigned by ae</div>
            <p class="sub_text">July 2006 </p>
            <p>Mhkonline is to be redesigned by ae. This is done because, the vision and the purpose of the site has changed. From a personal site, to one that provides solutions and tutorials to designers, developers and students. We have also changed the main theme color for the site. The site was optimised carefully taking into account a number of design aspects. We completely redesigned all the sections except Solutions. Take a look at the Design for more info on the design side of this project.</p>
