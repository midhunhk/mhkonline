      <H4 align="left">The past of Mhkonline </H4>
      <span class="sub_text">December 2006</span>
      <p align="justify">We started Mhkonline back in April 2004 as a personal site. The newly formed interest in web designing meant that a personal website was a must. It got some respectable amount of page hits from friends, beta testers and other people. Thank you for providing us with support so that we have grown to this level. </p>
      <p align="justify">By early 2005 thoughts were given to the fact that the site must be updated and thus began a two month long routine of redesigning the site. So in April 2005, celeberating 1st anniversary, we had Mhkonline2 - the successor to Mhkonline. It also meant a change of address - <span class="falselink">geocities.com/mhkonline2/</span>. It had some major graphical advancement over the previous version. The flash intro was a good idea. The homepage layout had a larger header image than what we have now. It was a kind of design issue. We work in 1024 X 768 resolution and failed to notice that in lower resolutions, the header would take up half the screen area! </p>
      <p align="justify">So as tradition follows we were all set to redesign the site for 2006 but were faced with many delays. We wanted to make this site useful to other people. Then came the idea of adding tutorials. So sharing of knowledge free of cost and marketing our products on the web. A number of Research and Development innovations have taken place. We have innovatingly added a sitemap, the navigation system has been made simple and effective. A small intro and a contrasting homepage with white and violet takes the visitor completely by surprise. An additional feature is the wallpapers section in Downloads. We have released a number of wallpapers in connection with the site, our sotwares and other events. </p>
