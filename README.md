# mhkonline
An archived copy of my personal website created back in 2005-2006 and was hosted on GeoCities.com.  

_It was a pain to upload few files at a time using file browser over dial up internet connection._

The sources were thought to be lost, until discovered from an old hard disk backup. It is structured as microsites with each one having a different theme and layout.

## Notes
- :confused: For layout purposes `table` tags are used as was standard back in the early 2000s.
- :unamused: Images were sliced to minimum widths and to enable faster parallel downloads as well as compressed jpegs.
- :sweat_smile: Pixel units were used as well as inline styles, a lot
- :cold_sweat: Designed for a screen size of 780px was norm 
- :sunglasses: Originally titled "mhkonline revision version 3"
- :grey_question: Era before flexbox and grid
- :boom:Some links maybe broken due to dynamic url generation

## Modifications
- The website used a Flash animation intro page, which was common for personal websites at that time.
Since the Flash player is no longer supported by modern browsers, for aesthetic reasons those sections are commented out.
- Few design tweaks like margins and paddings are updated for modern standards
- Some resources and paths have been re-organized
